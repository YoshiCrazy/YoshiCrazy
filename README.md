- I am a kinda lazy-ass developer
- Idk why I'm doing this, sake of my future... I guess.
- I want to become a Developer/Artist for Indie videogames
- I barely only know Java so uhh... I'll later learn other languages.
- Eat, sleep, draw, program, repeat.
- I am the Ultimate Lifeform
- Also PEAKori more funny than Futaba

Do NOT ask me what games I play, I already told you, I AM THE ULTIMATE Lifeform.
